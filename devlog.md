# Development Log
> A successful final project is built slowly over many weeks not thrown together at the last minute. To incentivize good project pacing and to let your project mentor stay informed about the status of your work, each week you should add an entry to your log.md file in the development directory.

> Each entry should describe:

> - What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not
> - What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals
> - What you plan to accomplish or attempt next week

> The development log will be graded for completion, detail, and honesty â€“ not progress. It is much better to truthfully evaluate the work you completed in a week then lie to make the project sound further along then it really is. It is totally acceptable to have an entry that says you tried nothing and accomplished nothing. However if every week starts to say that, both yourself and your project mentor will be able to identify the issue before it becomes impossible to fix.

## Week 5 (26 Jul - 1 Aug)

Finish Writing Proposal and Planning + Prior research for Project. Also update Development Log. 

--> This goal was completed succesfully, with the Proposal being completed and Submitted on the 1st of August. The development log was also updated successfully. 

## Week 6 (2 Aug - 8 Aug)

Start Implementing Student Record Tracking System

--> This goal was completed successfully. The Class "Student", as well as the user interface with the program, was coded successfully. Additionally, I was also able to do additional work this week, and start coding for sub-functions such as "Add Student". 

--> However, one challenge I am facing is that I am having trouble with importing functions from other files into the main user interface. Whenever the user selects a function they want, such as "Add Student", the program does not import this function from another file, but instead exits the program. This is something I spent very long (about 3 hours) trying to fix, but am still unable to do so. 

## Week 7 (9 Aug - 15 Aug)

Finish Implementing Student Record Tracking System

--> This week was super busy with WAs, Science RE submission, etc., so I was not able to work on the project as much. 
--> It greatly helped that I could do extra work last week.
--> The bug is unfortunately still unfixed. 

## Week 8 (16 Aug - 22 Aug)

--> After trying for about an hour, I was able to to fix the bug in importing functions from other files into the main user interface. 

--> I was also able to finish coding for several sub-functions including "Add Student", "Update Student Offence List", "Update Student Badge List". 

--> I really tried to code for certain sub-functions like "Remove Student". However, even after about 3 hours of trying, I found great difficulty in finding ways, from both the Coursemology document, and online resources, to implement certain actions like removing entire rows from .csv files, and plan to work on them the following week. 

## Week 9 (23 Aug - 29 Aug)

## Week 10 (30 Aug - 5 Sep)

## Sep Holiday (5 Sep - 10 Sep) **Submission date is 10 Sep**
