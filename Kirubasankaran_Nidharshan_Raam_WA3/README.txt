Welcome to my Project!!!

For the project to run, please run the python file:
1CEP_WA3_userint.py, in the folder named "Codes".

Please remember not to delete any of these three files, in the folder, under any circumstances:

(1) Dataset.csv
(2) LogisticsList.csv
(3) Events.csv

Thank you very much!

- On certain mysterious occasions, after the python file starts running, LogisticsList.csv
and Dataset.csv are erased. This problem does not occur on my computer, but occurs when my 
files are uploaded online and are then downloaded for running. However, this is a very very minor issue. If this does happen to be the case, please press (Command + Z) or (Control + Z) on your computer. This reverses the changes, which removed the information present in the 2 datasets, and retrieves back the data stored in both the files. 

So, once running the program, please make sure that your LogisticsList.csv looks something like this, in its raw format. 

## Object   ,Quantity   ,Logistics Accessible   
## First Aid Kit   ,23   ,15
## Roller Bandages   ,202   ,100
## Triangular Bandages   ,504   ,300
## Gauges   ,82   ,50
## Saline Solution   ,53   ,20
## Plasters   ,202   ,90   


Thank you very much, and I hope you enjoy using the program!!! xDD
