# General description of project
> Building a Student and CCA record tracking system for Raffles Institution Red Cross. 

#Goals of project
> Simplifying the job of tracking achievements, offences and attendance of students in the CCA, and equipment, logistics and events management. 

# Listing of features

> For every student in the CCA, one with access to the program can track his/her achievements (badges earned) throughout their learning experience in the CCA, and also the number of specific offences that he/she has committed, along with the date and time of those offences. The program will also be able to function in equipment management, in which specific equipments can be removed from the list due to various reasons such as damage. Important events happening in the CCA can also be tracked by the program, which will take down the event name, description, date, budget, etc. Most importantly, attendence of students can be recorded in the program, which can be easily accessed via another built-in function in the program.

> The main thing that my program offers is ease of accessibility of information. Instead of having a single excel sheet with thousands of rows which take long periods to access, my program allows seniors in the CCA to access the information they want in a matter of seconds. This ultimately improves efficiency of the CCA and their ability to store student and CCA data/information.

# External Scanning
> There were no similar apps / codebase that I found online that was similar to the project I wish to embark on. 

# Listing of Key Use Cases

> As mentioned above, tracking of everything that goes on in the CCA is a senior's role, including student and equipment management. Nowadays seniors have heavy trouble keeping track of all these things, as there are extremely large and numerous excel sheets to constantly have to refer to, in order to find information about students/equipment and update them. Things can be made much more simple, neat and accessible with a program that implements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> Creating and Storing Data in Large Databases, and Efficient Memory use.
