# General description of project
> Building a Student and CCA record tracking system for Raffles Institution Red Cross. 

#Goals of project
> Simplifying the job of tracking attendance, achievements and offences of students in the CCA, and equipment/logistics management. 

# Listing of features
> For every student in the CCA, one with access to the program can track his/her achievements (badges earned) and attendance in the CCA, and also the number of specific offences that he/she has committed, along with the date and time of those offences. Achievements, attendance and offences can similarly be added or removed from the dataset, at a specific date (which will also be recorded). The program will also be able to function in equipment management, in which specific equipments can be added or removed from the list. Damaged items may also be recorded in the list. 

# External Scanning
> There were no similar apps / codebase that I found online that was similar to the project I wish to embark on. 

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> As mentioned above, tracking of everything that goes on in the CCA is a senior's role, including student and equipment management. Nowadays seniors have heavy trouble keeping track of all these things, as there are extremely large and numerous excel sheets to constantly have to refer to, in order to find information about students/equipment and update them. Things can be made much more simple, neat and accessible with a program that implements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
